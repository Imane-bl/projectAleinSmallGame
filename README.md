########Interactive Visuals with Processing###############
This project is a dynamic and interactive visual application built using
the Processing programming language. It incorporates various graphical elements, animations,
and interactive features to create an engaging visual experience.

############Key Features:##########################################
#Alien Interaction:

A visually appealing animated alien figure that reacts to the user's mouse movements within a specified area on the screen.
The alien's appearance changes dynamically based on its interaction with the user's mouse cursor.

#Visual Effects:

Rain Simulation: Simulated rainfall that descends across the screen, creating an atmospheric effect.
Moving Circles: Animated circles move across the interface, providing an interactive visual element.
Background Color Changes: The background color dynamically changes over time, creating a shifting visual backdrop.

#Game-Like Elements:

Score Tracking: Displays a score counter that increments based on specific interactions with falling objects or other on-screen elements.
Life Points: Represents a health indicator that decreases based on certain interactions or conditions within the visual environment.
Usage Instructions:
Running the Application:

Ensure you have the Processing environment installed on your system.
Open the provided .pde file in the Processing IDE.
Click the "Run" button within the IDE to launch the application.

###################Interacting with the Visuals:#####################

Observe the behavior of the animated elements, especially the alien figure's response to your mouse movements within its designated area.
Explore the rain simulation and other moving visual elements that react to your interactions.
Gameplay Experience:

Keep track of your score, which increases as you interact with specific on-screen elements.
Monitor the life points displayed on the screen, which decrease under certain conditions.
Code Structure:
The code is organized into classes and functions, each controlling specific visual elements or interactions.
You can modify the code to experiment with different visual effects, interactions, or game mechanics.
